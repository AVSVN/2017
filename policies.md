**Required Textbook**

see [Resources](/resources.html) page.

**Online Discussion Forum**

We'll be using [Piazza](https://piazza.com/) as our online forum.

## Course Components

**Lectures and Labs**

The class meets twice a week for lectures (Tuesday And Thursday) and Friday for  labs. The labs are designed to help you master the relevant materials, and to start work on your homework in groups, and to even make progress on your project.  The weekly schedule is posted at [Schedule](/schedule.html).

Lab is compulsory.

**Homework**

34 points

There will be a homework every week with a maximum of 2 questions. This homework should not take more than 4 hours.

**Long-Format Homework**

48 points

There will be one long format homework every two weeks, except over spring break when you will have 3 weeks instead of two. The long-format homework will be assigned along with the regular homework. The long format homework should be doable within 8-10 hours. This means that all homework included, you ought to be spending about 8-10 hours per week on homework.

**Final exam**

At the end of the semester there will be a take home exam, which will be about 1.5 long format homework long. You will have >10 days to finish it.

## Course Policies

**Assessment Procedure**

Everything will be graded holistically beyond mechanical correctness and focusing on the overall quality of the work.

On a ten point scale, roughly:

- 10 = You should be a teaching fellow
- 9 = Excellent
- 7 = Good
- 4 = Fair
- 2 = Poor
- 0 = Did not participate / did not hand in

In addition to the scores the Teaching Fellows will give detailed written feedback.

**Collaboration Policy**

You can collaborate with upto two additional people on long-format homework.

**Quoting Sources**

You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. However, you are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise! You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided its license allows you to re-use it. You must quote the source using  proper citations (author, year, title, time accessed, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material. You may not use existing complex combinations or large examples. For example, you may not use a ready to use multiple linked view visualization. You may use parts out of such examples. To support your learning about academic citation rules, please visit the Harvard Extension School [Tips to Avoid Plagiarism](www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/resources/tips-avoid-plagiarism), where you'll find links to the Harvard Guide to Using Sources and two, free, online 15-minute tutorials to test your knowledge of academic citation policy. The tutorials are anonymous open-learning tools.



**Lab Deadlines and Late Days**

Homework and Project **must** be turned in on time, including the long-format homework.

Exceptions: Nada. No exceptions, except for illness, with a doctor's certificate.

**Regrading Policy**

If you think we were too harsh, please ask for a regrade within a day of getting your grade.

A lot of the material in this course is based on other classes. We have also heavily drawn on materials and examples found online and tried our best to give credit by linking to the original source. Please contact us if you find materials where the credit is missing or that you would rather have removed.


**Code**

We expect you to write high-quality and readable python code. You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reusability, error handling, etc. We also expect you to reasonably document your code.
